**Some open questions**:
* Why not just compile DNA -> Protein? Why the RNA step at all? Computationally seems like you're just swapping out the thymine for the uracil...
    * Seems like part of the answer here is that DNA is just the template, RNA is the messenger molecule because it's more reactive chemically, so it economizes on energy; DNA, being more stable, is a better and more reliable "store of information", RNA is a better "doer of things"
* How does the ribosomal frameshifting work, mechanistically?
* Why is orf1ab so large / what's the advantage of a polyprotein vs. many individual proteins?
* What is the point of all the random little proteins? 
* How does one learn what each protein does, apart from observing the virus do its thing? Preusmably one can guess from previous studies of the virus, but how did they originally figure this out. 
* How did biology even evolve ribosomal frameshifting... 

**TODOS**:
* Something to automatically parse the genome and grab the proteins, throw into a table sorted descending by length
* Sequence comparison tool so you can see insertions/deletions from previous coronaviruses
*
